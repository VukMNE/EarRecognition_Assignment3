# EarRecognition_Assignment3

This repository is the result of work on Ear recognition assignment from Image based biometry course at Faculty of Information Science and technology, at University of Ljubljana.

The model used is Convolutional Neural Network, and the network structure is motivated by the results of the study that can be found on the following link: https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-bmt.2016.0002

We have achieved classification accuracy of 7%. 

Network has 6 Convolutional, 3 MaxPool, 3 Dropout and 3 Dense Layers in total.

### How to see the results

Results are available within Jupyter notebook in this repository, or via jupyter notebook on Google colab, here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TEsgB1DPE7lBpJMPGprIurgHPjBg50Fp?usp=sharing
